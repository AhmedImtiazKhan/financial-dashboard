# Financial Dashboard Application

This project is a **Financial Dashboard Application** built using **Next.js**, following the official Next.js course. It implements key concepts such as dynamic routing, server-side rendering, authentication, and error handling, following the chapters of the course.

## Project Features Based on Course Chapters:

- **Getting Started**: Initial setup of the Next.js application with basic configuration and folder structure.
- **CSS Styling**: Applied styling using CSS modules for modular and scoped styling across components.
- **Optimizing Fonts and Images**: Leveraged Next.jsâ€™s built-in optimizations for font loading and image handling.
- **Creating Layouts and Pages**: Created reusable layouts and dynamic pages using the Next.js routing system.
- **Navigating Between Pages**: Implemented seamless navigation between different sections of the dashboard.
- **Setting Up Your Database**: Connected the application to a database for managing customer and invoice data.
- **Fetching Data**: Integrated server-side data fetching using Next.js API routes.
- **Static and Dynamic Rendering**: Applied both static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) for optimized performance.
- **Streaming**: Utilized React's streaming feature for faster user experiences.
- **Partial Prerendering**: Implemented Next.js's partial prerendering to optimize rendering time for specific pages.
- **Adding Search and Pagination**: Built a search functionality and implemented pagination for customer and invoice listings.
- **Mutating Data**: Enabled data mutation through forms and actions for creating, updating, and deleting data.
- **Handling Errors**: Added comprehensive error handling to ensure the application is resilient and user-friendly.
- **Improving Accessibility**: Applied accessibility improvements, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- **Adding Authentication**: Secured the application with user authentication using NextAuth.js.
- **Adding Metadata**: Added metadata (e.g., Open Graph, SEO) for better sharing and discoverability.

## Technology Stack:

- **Next.js**: Utilized for server-side rendering, dynamic routing, and fast front-end development.
- **NextAuth.js**: Implemented for user authentication and session management.
- **TypeScript**: Ensured type safety across the project.
- **Zod**: Used for schema validation in forms and authentication.
- **PNPM**: Package manager for efficient dependency management.

## Key Pages and Features:

- **/login**: User authentication page with form validation and secure login.
- **/dashboard**: Displays key financial metrics and insights.
- **/dashboard/customers**: Manages customer information with search and pagination.
- **/dashboard/invoices**: Manages invoices with features to create, edit, and delete entries.
